Using reinforcement learning to teach an AI to play snake


* To download the code : `git clone https://github.com/sfatew/Snake_ai_group.git`.
* To install requirements libraries: `pip install -q -r requirements.txt`
* To run the file: `python main.py`

We also propose multiple models, agents and game implimentation each are slightly different from each other. Though we recomend to use agent + model2 + game since agenttest1 + model2 + game_2 is not yet to stable.
